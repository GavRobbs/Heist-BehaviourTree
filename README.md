# Behaviour Tree Demo

A simple demo I made to teach myself the basics of behaviour trees. This is a stripped down version of the Unity and C# course that can be found at https://www.udemy.com/course/behaviour-trees/.

This example demonstrates:
- Action Nodes
- Condition Nodes
- Sequence Nodes
- Selector Nodes
- Inverters
